As the name suggests, Rear Factory is an organization where all the codes are stored, deployed and maintained that are to be sold to clients in the relevant markets or need to be given special attention from the Research and Development Wing of MWS Team. The Rear Factory aims at stationing the best quality of codes, research materials and non-public information sources. For a business to be maintained and developed, its understandable to have a bunch of readymade supplies just to tear down and be delivered with the best results.
