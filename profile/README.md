As the name suggests, this organization is dedicated for the storage of all sorts of tools and knowledge base which might seem very basic to be included in other organization repositories but are essential to be kept handy. This might range from simple pattern generation programs to Arduino LED blinker codes. Just a bunch of rare ideas to be honest.
